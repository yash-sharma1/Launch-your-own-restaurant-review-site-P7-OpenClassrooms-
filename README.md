# Launch-your-own-restaurant-review-site-P7-OpenClassrooms-
You've chosen to get started in the restaurant review business! Your goal is to create an easy-to-use, simple service that offers reviews of restaurants around you.  For this project, you have to learn to use external APIs such as Google Maps and Google Places (your biggest competitor ðŸ˜¬). That's not all: you will have to integrate all this information in a clear, organized way in your application!  You will also be required to code using good coding practices like you've learned so far, among which object-oriented programming is one of the most important.
